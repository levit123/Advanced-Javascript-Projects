	<!--uses the ng-app directive from AngularJS to display the result of the math operation
		in the curly braces. Without the ng-app directive, it will just display it as text,
		like "{{ 3 + 5 }}". In the below example, the ng-app directive refers to an
		HTML element with the name "myApp", in which the Angular application will run.

		Also uses the ng-controller directive to refer to the controller the application
		will use, which in this case is named "myController"
		-->
	<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myController">
		<p>My first expression: {{ 3 + 5 }}</p>

		<b><p>My name is {{ firstName + " " + lastInit }}</p></b>

		<!--uses the ng-init attribute to initialize the "artistName" ng-model variable
			with a starting value, which the user can then change by typing
			into the <input> element-->
		<div ng-init="artistName='SwuM'">
			<p>Favorite Artist Name: <input type="text" ng-model="artistName"></p>
			<p>You wrote: {{ artistName }}</p>
		</div>

	<script>
		//defines and sets up the Angular module in which the application will run
		//and names it "myApp"
		var app = angular.module("myApp", []);

		//defines the controller for the "myApp" module and names it "myController".
		//Also defines the pieces of the data model (think of it similar to properties
		//of a class, in the sense that they're pieces of info inherent to this
		//data model and can be referenced in other parts of the module)
		app.controller("myController", function($scope) {
			//defines the data model values for "firstName" and "lastInit"
			$scope.firstName = "Levi";
			$scope.lastInit = "B.";
